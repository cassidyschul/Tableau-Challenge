Module 18 Write- Up

Visualizations and dashboards based on Citi Bike data from June to August 2013 were created to identify trends and insights.
 
The first phenomenon investigated using Citi Bike data was to determine if there was a gender difference among riders who used Citi Bikes from June to August 2013. The data revealed a higher percentage of males using the bikes compared to females. This finding is not surprising, as women's clothing may not always be suited for bike riding, while men's clothing typically is. Additionally, it was found that females have a longer average trip duration than males. This could be because males tend to travel more quickly from the starting to the ending location, or because females generally take longer trips. Lastly, the popular ride hours were examined, showing that both males (blue) and females (red) follow the same pattern, with peak hours around 7-8 AM and 5-7 PM. This likely correlates with commuting times, suggesting that most riders use the bikes to commute to work.
 
The second phenomenon investigated using Citi Bike data was to determine if there was an age difference among riders who used Citi Bikes from June to August 2013.
 
The data showed that the most common birth years for riders in 2013 were between 1978 and 1987, making them 26 to 35 years old. Age did not significantly impact popular ride times, as peak ride hours were consistent across the top 10 birth years. This trend is unsurprising, as many individuals in this age range likely work full-time positions that require commuting to the office. Additionally, they would have the athletic capability to ride a bike and might prefer a cheaper commuting option over driving or taking a taxi. The average trip duration for the top 10 birth years was also examined, revealing minimal differences, with trips averaging between 14 and 15 minutes.
 
Two maps were created to display all the start and end stations, represented in blue, and the top 10 most popular stations, represented in red. Comparing these maps revealed that the top 10 start and end stations were nearly identical. The data also indicated that most riders are commuting within Manhattan, as the popular stations are exclusively located there, rather than in Queens or Brooklyn. Furthermore, the most popular stations are concentrated in the Flatiron District, Union Square, and Tribeca. This suggests that individuals living in these neighborhoods are more likely to use Citi Bikes as a mode of transportation.
